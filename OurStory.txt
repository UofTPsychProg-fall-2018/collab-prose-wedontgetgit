Giddy with Git

One day, we tried to figure out git.
It took us a while... but we worked through it bit by bit.

We worked so hard that we got hungry for lunch
but it was close to 1:00 pm, that it was basically brunch.

Then Marilyne gave us some tomatoes from her garden.
They had some good crunch.

We are still hungry.
But now we get git a little more.
It is kinda fun.
