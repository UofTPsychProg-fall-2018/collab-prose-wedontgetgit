Giddy with Git

One day, we tried to figure out git.
It took us a while... but we worked through it bit by bit.

We worked so hard that we got hungry for lunch
but it was so close to 1:00 pm, that it was basically brunch!!

Then Marilyne gave us some tomatoes from her garden.
They had some good crunch.

We are still hungry but now we get git a little more.
It is kinda fun.

We are now going to get some real lunch.

It is really late lunch as we find the moon has climbed up above trees.
Anyway, the lunch-supper is supper delicious.
Hunger is always the best condiment making food tasty.
After a fruitful day, we also have a sound sleep.
End.
